# Web-Application-Project
In this project i was given a vehicle dealership and its listing information. Ive done a good amount of exploratory analysis and have come to a few conclusions. these will be properly illustrated in the web application we are inputting the data into as well. this is a tool to simulate random events and ive implemented various libraries including seaborn, pandas, plotly.express, math, numpy, datetime, scipy.stats, matplotlib. you can get to the Website by simply deploying the GitHub in render.com and then copying this URL: https://web-application-project.onrender.com/
